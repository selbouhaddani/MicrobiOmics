***Route to the UMC Utrecht***

You can get the travel costs reimbursed, but unfortunately not the parking costs.

-   By public transport: From the train station Utrecht Centraal, there are trams and busses to the hospital. Use e.g. <https://9292.nl/> with end destination the tram/busstop "UMC Utrecht". **NOTE there are strikes planned on 20 March. Please double check 9292.nl a few days beforehand.**
-   By car: Type in "Bolognalaan 2, Utrecht" in your navigation system and follow the signs "P UMC Utrecht". In Google Maps, search for "UMC Utrecht -Â  Parkeergarage Zuid". The parking costs are EUR 1.80 per hour. Alternatively, you can park at [the P+R Science Park](https://www.p1.nl/parkeren/utrecht/p-r-utrecht-science-park) for EUR 6.30 for a whole day including a 7 minutes bus ride to the UMC Utrecht.

***Route to the meeting room***

After entering via the UMC Utrecht main entrance, go **left**. Walk past a small restaurant (Vermaat) until you come at a T junction with a red floor. Go **right** through a hallway with swinging doors. Upon exiting the hallway, turn **left** and walk past the Stratenum reception. [This route is visually available online](https://plattegrondumcutrecht.nl/#map/d0_d245/panorama), in a Google street view style.

Directly after the reception you will find elevators, take one to the **top (fifth) floor**. After exiting the elevators, turn right and keep on walking until you passed through a glass hallway/bridge with swinging doors.

The last swinging door is secured with a pass reader. In case the door is closed and I am not near, or there is another problem, please call me (Said) [see phone number in the email].

***WIFI*** Eduroam is available, as well as a UMC Utrecht Guest network throughout the building.
